## Phase 0 Planning

Read all the documents in @planning 
Read https://martin-fieber.de/blog/lua-project-setup-with-luarocks/
Read through the @planning/phase-0-guide.md and the linked resources.
Take your time to think about the information and digest it.

Now create a detailed, step-by-step plan for phase 0 based on @planning/phase-0-guide.md
Be specific about every step and include all necessary commands, file names, and configurations.

 I think before we can call Phase 0 complete, we need to ensure the following:
 We should prove in the most basic way that diligent will be able to comunicate with AwesomeWM.
 diligent will have to be able to start and stop clients with awesomewm. 
 Lets add some very rudimentary code to the project that will prove that this is possible. The DSL is not required for this.
 After that we will really be ready to start on Phase 1.

Think about how to implement this and create a plan for it.
