# TDD-Based Start Handler Refactoring Plan (Phase 7)

## TDD Implementation Strategy: Red → Green → Refactor

This plan follows strict Test-Driven Development with each step beginning with failing tests, followed by minimal implementation to pass, then refactoring for quality.

## 📊 Current Status

### 🎯 **REFACTORING COMPLETE ✅**

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Problems Identified

1. ✅ ~~**Data Format Inconsistency**~~: ~~Handler uses `{name, tag_spec}` but tag_mapper expects `{id, tag}`, requiring transformation at lines 154-160 in start.lua~~ → **RESOLVED in Cycle 1**
2. ✅ ~~**Fail-Fast Tag Resolution**~~: ~~Individual tag resolution failures now have fallback support, but integration layer can still fail on critical errors~~ → **RESOLVED in Cycle 2 (structured error handling with comprehensive fallbacks)**
3. ✅ ~~**Spawning Logic Duplication**~~: ~~`awe_module.spawn.spawner.spawn_with_properties` called in two places (lines 62-70 and 192-200)~~ → **RESOLVED in Cycle 3 (dedicated spawn_resources function)**
4. ✅ ~~**Complex Error Handling**~~: ~~`format_error_response()` function is 120 lines (40% of the file) with mixed concerns~~ → **RESOLVED in Cycle 4 (clean build_combined_response function)**
5. ✅ ~~**Mixed Responsibilities**~~: ~~`format_error_response()` does both data transformation AND business logic (spawning applications)~~ → **RESOLVED in Cycle 4 (clear separation of concerns)**
6. ✅ ~~**Complex Partial Success Logic**~~: ~~Nested loops and resource matching add unnecessary complexity~~ → **RESOLVED in Cycle 4 (simple success criteria and error collection)**

### ✅ Clean Flow Achieved (After Cycle 4 - Simplified Handler)
```
Handler {name, tag_spec}
    ↓ (✅ NO transformation needed - ACHIEVED!)
tag_mapper {name, tag_spec} → enhanced error handling, returns (success, result)
    ↓ (individual resolution failures have fallbacks, comprehensive error collection)
spawn_resources() → dedicated spawning function (✅ IMPLEMENTED!)
    ↓ (resilient spawning, succeeds if ANY resource spawns)
build_combined_response() → clean response construction (✅ NEW!)
    ↓ (50 lines of focused response building logic)
Clean, consistent response structure
```

**Key Achievements in Cycle 4:**
- 🎯 **Pure Orchestration Handler**: `execute()` function simplified to 25 lines of coordination
- 🧹 **Eliminated Complex Error Handler**: Removed 100-line `format_error_response()` function completely
- 🔧 **Clean Response Builder**: New `build_combined_response()` function with single responsibility
- 📊 **Consistent Response Structure**: Standard format for success, partial success, and failure scenarios
- ✨ **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Tag resolution, spawning, and response building fully isolated

### 🎯 Target Clean Flow - ACHIEVED! ✅
```
Handler {name, tag_spec}
    ↓ (✅ no transformation needed - ACHIEVED!)
tag_mapper {name, tag_spec} → always succeed with fallbacks, errors in metadata
    ↓ (clean resolved_tags + error metadata - ACHIEVED!)
spawn_resources() → dedicated spawning function
    ↓ (clean spawned_resources + spawn metadata - ACHIEVED!)
build_combined_response() → simple response construction - ACHIEVED!
```

## Enhanced Architecture Design

### New API Signatures

```lua
-- tag_mapper.resolve_tags_for_project (enhanced)
function tag_mapper.resolve_tags_for_project(resources, base_tag, interface)
  -- resources: {name, tag_spec} format (consistent throughout pipeline)
  -- Always returns true unless critical system error
  return true, resolved_tags, metadata
  -- resolved_tags: {[resource_name] = tag_object} with fallbacks for failed resolutions
  -- metadata: {tag_operations, errors, warnings, fallback_usage}
end

-- New spawn_resources function
function spawn_resources(resolved_tags, resources, awe_module)
  -- Returns true if ANY resource spawns successfully
  return success, spawned_resources, metadata
  -- spawned_resources: [{name, pid, snid, command, tag_spec}]
  -- metadata: {spawn_results, errors, total_attempted, success_count}
end

-- Simplified handler.execute
function handler.execute(payload)
  -- 1. Tag resolution (with fallbacks)
  local tag_success, resolved_tags, tag_metadata = tag_mapper.resolve_tags_for_project(
    payload.resources, -- {name, tag_spec} directly - no transformation!
    current_tag_index,
    interface
  )
  
  -- 2. Resource spawning
  local spawn_success, spawned_resources, spawn_metadata = spawn_resources(
    resolved_tags,
    payload.resources,
    awe_module
  )
  
  -- 3. Response building
  return build_combined_response(tag_metadata, spawn_metadata, payload)
end
```

### Fallback Strategy Design

**Tag Resolution Fallbacks (Priority Order)**:
1. **Successful resolution**: Use resolved tag as normal
2. **Failed relative/absolute**: Fall back to current_tag
3. **Failed named tag**: Fall back to current_tag  
4. **No current_tag available**: Fall back to tag 1
5. **Tag 1 unavailable**: Fall back to tag 1 with mock object

**Error Collection**: All resolution failures are collected in `metadata.errors` but don't prevent operation completion.

**Success Strategy**: `tag_mapper` returns `true` unless critical system errors (interface failure, invalid inputs, etc.)
